Radioactive Earth

1. Characters <br />
You’re a scientist that worked for the United States military, who has created a cryogenic sleep capsule. You wanted to have safety from the upcoming nuclear warfare, so you went into your capsule. However, during your sleep, radiation has engulfed the planet, so the plants and animals began to mutate. There are the same animals and plants that you know of but with a twist–some have grown extra limbs, gained increased size, and have a new distinct feature about them. 

2. Story/Narrative <br />
The year is 2070 and the world is being destroyed by nuclear warfare. You are a military scientist who has been researching cryogenic sleep and its potential. With your single prototype chamber, you use it to avoid death in your lab. You awaken from your 200 year slumber to find that the Earth has been ravaged by nuclear warfare. Using the remaining supplies and power from your lab, you construct a suit and gun that would allow you to survive the surface radiation and combat enemies. Humanity has largely been destroyed with anyone that didn’t get taken out by the nuclear fallout eliminated from the mutated creatures. The monsters are active during the day due to the energy provided from the sun. You need energy to fuel your lab, so you can continue to survive, so you must venture out and deal with these monsters.

3. Game World <br />
The game world is a post-apocalyptic setting, overrun with radioactive monsters. The more local setting takes place within your lab and the surrounding terrain where enemies will spawn and move towards the player.

4. Gameplay <br />
Our game genre can be loosely classified as 3rd person shooter roguelike with tower defense elements. For the main gameplay, the game will take the form of a third-person shooter. You fight by shooting enemies during the day, while upgrading at night. Lab upgrades can include turrets/traps which incorporate subtle tower defense elements. It isn’t strictly a roguelike but does have some aspects of roguelikes because players make upgrades during runs and can use currency to make permanent upgrades outside of specific runs. Every few rounds, there may be a more powerful mini-boss that will be difficult to defeat.

Overall (Long Term) : Survive as many rounds as you can in order to approach the final boss. <br />
Rounds (Short Term) : Defeat the enemies presented to you and upgrade your current self and the laboratory. 

5. Game Mechanics <br />
Moving the player within the 3d range with WASD. Sprinting can be utilized with the shift key in order to gain a boost of speed. The player can aim with the mouse and shoot with the left mouse button. The player can melee attack with the V key or the right mouse button.
The player wants to focus on killing enemies and collecting radiation dropped from enemies. Enemies will spawn during the day time and the player can use the collected radiation to convert it into power in the lab. This can upgrade the player making them more powerful for the upcoming day, which should be harder than the last.

6. Items, Loots, and Power-ups <br />
Throughout the game the player can use his collected radiation in order to upgrade his suit or his weapons, gun and knife. These upgrades will consist of : Suit: health, damage reduction, speed, Gun : Damage, Firing rate, Clip Size, Knife: Damage, Range. There will be more upgrades created as we finish the foundations. Furthermore, players can spend currency accumulated across runs to make permanent upgrades to their character.

7. Game Rules <br />
Once the player dies, the game is lost and over. The players have a health bar that can be damaged by enemy attacks. To win the game, players will need to survive through the rounds and defeat the final boss. They can restart a run and use upgrades to make the next run easier. 

8. Target Audience <br />
This game is for anyone who is a fan of roguelikes, 3rd person shooters, and tower defense games. Our game blends some elements from each of these genres. We want to make the game simple and straightforward.

9. Artwork <br />
We will need some artwork for our apocalyptic gameworld, weapons, and enemies, the mutated plants and animals. We have looked a little online and at the assets provided, however haven’t made any set decisions yet.

10. GDD Process <br />
We talked about a few games each of us played and enjoyed. Then collaborated about their similar features and our current knowledge of unity. We took inspiration from games with similar genre and playstyles, most notably Risk of Rain 2 and Vampire Survivors.
